<p class="short-summary">How this blog came to be.</p>
<!--more-->

Once upon a time this blog didn't exist. And then it did, thanks to some good ol' fashioned mentoring and learning the tools to make this a possibility. So, what's more fitting that utilising this beautifully built blog to blab about its conception and birth as a first post? Nothing, exactly. Well, let's get to it, shall we?

### Part I: Internet-ing
So what the hell is a website anyway? Well, it's basically a collection of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some other junk, sometimes hooked up to databases for keeping all the crap we like to post online. And the thing about making one nowadays vs. back in the 90s is that you've got all these amazing tools to help you (and no, I don't mean WordPress or Squarespace). One of these tools is called [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/). 

### Part II: Gulp, Quenching Even the Most Diabolical Thirst
...at least that's what 7-11 says. But yes, this totally applies, it'll satisfy your need for a static site tool (SST). So why use an SST? For one thing, it's great for quick prototyping, and it gives you a high level of control. And if you're like me, having control is over your project is high up on your list of "likes". Also, I don't like dealing with things like admin interfaces, things you'd see in a CMS; it's kind of an unnecessary intermediary, especially if you know and love to see code -- beautiful, majestic code. And if you're interested in reading more about static site generators, take a look at [this article from Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/).

Gulp also lets you utilise other powerful tools such as CSS pre-processors (Sass, Less), Markdown, and additionally, a shitload of other plugins that will make your life easier. Sounds pretty awesome so far, right? I thought so. And what better way to learn a new tool than to use it to make something of your own?  So if you're interested in trying out Gulp for your own site, keep reading. I'll run through the steps I took in creating this blog.
